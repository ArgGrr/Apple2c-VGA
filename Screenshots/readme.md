Added some videos I took with my phone, I don't have a VGA capture card.
Note some of the Total Replay screens are demos are clamped in green & purple. I think this is a bug running it on the 2c.

Additionally, the Crazy Cycles demo shows the way the FPGA handles TEXT and graphics mode. What ever is set at the start of the line is maintained through the whole line. Not enough BRAM to store it for evey pixel.
